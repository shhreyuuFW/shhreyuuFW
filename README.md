# Shreyash Patel

Hey there! I'm Shreyash Patel, A cybersecurity enthusiast, Python wrangler, and web dev explorer. I just graduated, so right now I'm in my "open to cool opportunities" era.

## 🚀 About Me
- Cybersecurity is my playground (I love breaking things... and then fixing them)
- Python is my go-to toolkit (scripts, dashboards, bots—you name it)
- Web dev? Been there, built that
- I vibe with creative chaos: painting, trekking, and cooking are my off-screen escapes

## 🌱 Currently
- Leveling up my skills, one project at a time
- Looking for my next adventure (hit me up if you have something wild in mind)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- Security tools, automation, and a sprinkle of web magic

## ✨ Motto
> "Stay curious, break boundaries, and always keep it real."
